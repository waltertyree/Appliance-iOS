WELCOME TO THE REPOSITORY FOR APPLIANCE

This is a project that I'm working on in my spare time and as a hobby. I do aspire to make it a full fledged iOS client for App.Net and release it on the App Store, we'll see.

Also, don't mind the Copyrights for now, that's the default stuff included by Xcode but I'll change it to a cooler license for everyone to use and enjoy :)
